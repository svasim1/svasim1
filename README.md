# Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Svante Ericsson!
Innovative technology developer with a focus on future solutions.

I have recently graduated from the technology specialization program at Hitachigymnasiet (formerly ABB-gymnasiet) in VÃ¤sterÃ¥s, where I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in programming, AI, IoT, cloud services and modern product development.

I am a committed and curious problem solver who is driven by the possibilities of technology. My passion for understanding, creating and improving makes me constantly want to learn more and develop. I am also a team player who thrives on collaboration, and combines my technical focus with structure, communication and accuracy to contribute to both a good atmosphere and strong results.

During high school, I have been involved in building everything from websites, apps and AI bots to games, drones and physical systems. Examples of projects I have worked on are an AI chatbot with RAG backend in Python, a surgeon simulator developed in collaboration with Region VÃ¤stmanland, and a radio-controlled vehicle that can be controlled over the network. I was also a web developer in RiksdagsTracker UF, where we took 4th place in the JA company of the year in VÃ¤stmanland 2025. Last but not least, I have received two awards during high school.
